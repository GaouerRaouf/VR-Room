# VR-Room

A simple VR Room where I used:
-Snap turn
-Teleportation
-Grabbable Objects
-VR sockets


The room was imported from a [course](https://learn.unity.com/mission/vr-basics?uv=2021.3&pathwayId=627c12d8edbc2a75333b9185) from [unity learn](https://learn.unity.com/) and it was provided with a [challenge](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-1-architecture-review?pathwayId=627c12d8edbc2a75333b9185&missionId=62554983edbc2a76a27486cb)
I solved all the challenges and the additional challenges
