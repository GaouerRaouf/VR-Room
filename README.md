#Room
A simple VR Room where I used:
-Custom hand models and reticles
-Objects with real world dimensions
-Snap turn (To use the joysticks to turn)
-Teleportation (To move inside the room)
-Grabbable Objects (To Grab objects like hats, tenis rackets)
-VR sockets (To put the hats on the hooks and even on my head)

#Challenge
The room was imported from a [course](https://learn.unity.com/mission/vr-basics?uv=2021.3&pathwayId=627c12d8edbc2a75333b9185) from [unity learn](https://learn.unity.com/) and it was provided with a [challenge](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/challenge-1-architecture-review?pathwayId=627c12d8edbc2a75333b9185&missionId=62554983edbc2a76a27486cb)
